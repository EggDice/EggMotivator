# EggMotivator

It is hard to focus if you are living with ADHD. This app, if switched on, sends
you notifications every 5 minutes to help you focus. If you have a smartwatch
the notification vibrates on your wrist, so you can get a mindful moment to
gather yourself, even if you started to drift away.
